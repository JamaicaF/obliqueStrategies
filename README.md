# Oblique Strategies

_Oblique Strategies_ is a creativity tool designed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. It originally took the form of a deck of cards, where each card offers a suggestion towards overcoming a creative block. Meditative, cryptic, or occasionally bombastic, each card's message is
open to interpretation.

** When I started learning to code, one of the first programs I wrote was a command line version of _Oblique Strategies_. (I wrote it in Ruby, and yes, it did contain some obscenely long methods, `$stdin.gets.chomp`, and `puts` many empty strings :D)
This is a DRYer, prettier version.
